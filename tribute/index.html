      <h2>Origin of the hussars</h2>
      <p>The first hussar regiments comprised the light cavalry of the <b>Black Army of Hungary</b>. The hussars took part in the war against to Ottoman Empire in 1485 and proved successful.
    The Polish Hussars were originally based on the Hungarian Hussars. Initially the first hussar units in the Kingdom of Poland were formed by the Polish parliament in 1503, which hired three banners of Hungarian mercenaries. Soon, recruitment also began among Polish citizens.</p>

      <h2>The winged hussars</h2>
      <p>The true "winged hussar" arrived with the reforms of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Bathory in the 1570s and was later led by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania John III Sobieski. The hussars were the <b>leading, or even elite</b>, branch of cavalry in the Polish army from the 1570s until 1776, when their duties and traditions were passed on to the Uhlans by a parliamentary decree. Most hussars were recruited from the wealthier Polish nobility (szlachta). Each hussar towarzysz ("comrade") raised his own poczet or lance/retinue. Several retinues were combined to form a hussar banner or company (chorągiew husarska).</p>

      <h2>Battle of Vienna</h2>
      <p>The Battle of Vienna was a turning point in the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The battle was fought by the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Poland against the ottomans. The siege began on July 14, 1683. The 15 000 Habsburg troops knew, they stood no chance against the turkish army counting 170 000 men, but the reinforcements were on the way.<b>Two months</b> into the siege, the defenders were fighting with their last strength. With most of the city walls destroyed, they were preparing to continue the fight on the streets of Vienna, if needed when the Holy League troops arrived. Soon, 18 000 horseman charged down from the hills. This is the largest known cavalry charge in history. The charge easily broke the lines of the Ottomans, who were exhausted and demoralized. The cavalry headed straight for the Ottoman camps, while the remaining Viennese garrison sallied out of its defenses to join in the assault</p>
